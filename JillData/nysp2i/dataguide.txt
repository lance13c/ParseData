Data Guide


So this is a mess, and I'm sorry. It was hard to run experiments 
throughout the day and come back every time.

This is what is true for every dataset:

1. Each Text document has a control run and an experiment run, 
seperated by a break.

2. For the purposes of analysis, only the last 15 minutes of each 
control is relevant, as well as the first 90 minutes of each experiment
run.
